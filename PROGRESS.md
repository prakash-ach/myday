# MYDAY — progress

Updated at the end of every working session. Read this before changing code.

## Where we are

**Phase 1 of 15 complete.** Foundation and responsive shell.
**Next: Phase 2** — Supabase, authentication, database schema, row level security.

## Done

### Phase 1 — foundation

- Next.js 16.3.5, React 19, TypeScript strict, Tailwind 4, App Router, `src/` layout
- Design tokens for light and dark in `src/app/globals.css`, all colour going
  through CSS variables so the accent becomes user-configurable in Phase 9
- Typography: Inter Tight for interface and figures, Newsreader for the greeting
- App shell: sidebar on desktop, bottom bar with centre add button on phones,
  top bar on mobile, theme switch with light / dark / match system
- Dashboard hero: live clock, greeting that changes through the day, weekday,
  date, and three counts (currently zero, because nothing is stored yet)
- Eleven routes, each with a written empty state rather than placeholder data
- Vitest with nine tests covering the time helpers, including a local-midnight
  case and daylight saving boundaries
- ESLint, Prettier, `npm run verify`, GitHub Actions CI with a secret scanner

### Verified

`npm run lint` · `npm run typecheck` · `npm run test` (9 passing) ·
`npm run build` (11 routes prerendered).

## Not done yet, by design

- No database, no authentication, no real data. The counts are zeroes and the
  add buttons are disabled rather than pretending to work.
- Search, settings and customisation screens are signposted, not built.

## Decisions made, and why

**Wall-clock vs instant time.** Task dates and times are stored as local date
and time plus the user's timezone; only real events (created, completed,
reminder fired) are timestamps. Stops "gym at 7am" drifting when daylight
saving changes. `src/lib/time.ts`, tested.

**Recurring tasks store a rule, not rows.** One task row with an RRULE,
occurrences expanded on read, `task_occurrences` holding only exceptions
(completed, skipped, moved). Avoids thousands of unmanageable future rows.

**Clock and theme read through `useSyncExternalStore`.** The usual
state-plus-effect hydration guard is flagged by React 19's lint rules and
costs an extra render. `src/lib/hooks/use-now.ts` and `use-hydrated.ts`.

**Green accent, not purple.** Explicit request. Every accent use goes through
`--accent` so Phase 9 can change it per user without touching components.

**Vercel builds, not the droplet.** The DigitalOcean droplet has 512 MB RAM;
a Next.js build wants 1–2 GB. Vercel's free tier does the building instead,
and the droplet keeps serving the older standalone task app until Phase 4.

## Known constraints

- `npm run build` cannot reach fonts.googleapis.com inside Claude's sandbox.
  A build that fails _only_ on `next/font/google` is the sandbox, not the code.
  Phase 1 was verified with the fonts stubbed, then restored.
- Supabase project `myday-prod` exists (East US). Not yet connected to the app.

## Phase 2 checklist

- [ ] `@supabase/supabase-js` and `@supabase/ssr`, browser and server clients
- [ ] Migration 001: profiles, user_preferences, categories, tags
- [ ] Migration 002: tasks, task_occurrences, subtasks, reminders
- [ ] RLS policy on every table, plus a test proving one user can't read another's rows
- [ ] Login page, session middleware, protected routes
- [ ] Generated database types into `src/types/database.ts`
- [ ] Vercel project connected, environment variables set
